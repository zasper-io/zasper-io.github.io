Zasper is an IDE designed from the ground up to support massive concurrency. It provides a minimal memory footprint, exceptional speed, and the ability to handle numerous concurrent connections.

It's perfectly suited for running REPL-style data applications, with Jupyter notebooks being one example.

## How is Zasper better than JupyterLab ?

* Upto 5X Lesser CPU usage 
* Upto 40X Lesser RAM 
* Higher throughput
* Lower latency
* Highly resilient under very high loads

Note: Jupyter Server powers Jupyterlab. Hence, I use the terms interchangeably.

# Introduction

The primary goal of this benchmarking exercise is to compare the performance of Zasper against the traditional Jupyter Server. The focus areas for evaluation are:

* CPU Usage
* RAM Usage
* Throughput
* Latency
* Resilience

Through this comparison, we aim to determine how Zasper performs in a real-world scenario where multiple execute requests are made, with particular interest in resource consumption and efficiency.


# Understanding Jupyter Server Architecture

To establish a baseline, it is important to understand how a Jupyter Server operates internally. Here's a simplified breakdown:

### 1. Session Lifecycle

A new session is initiated when a user opens a Jupyter notebook.

This session launches a kernel, which handles code execution.


### 2. Kernel Channels
The Jupyter kernel communicates with the server over five dedicated channels:
* stdin ‚Äì for user inputs.
* shell ‚Äì for sending execution requests.
* control ‚Äì for kernel control messages.
* iopub ‚Äì for publishing results back to the client.
* heartbeat ‚Äì for kernel liveliness checks.

üìå For this benchmarking exercise, we focus only on:

* Shell channel ‚Äì used to send execution requests (e.g., `2+2`, `print("Hello World!")`)
* IOPub channel ‚Äì used to receive outputs from the kernel (e.g., `4`, `Hello World!`)

### 3. Communication via WebSocket
A WebSocket is established between the Jupyter client and the server, allowing real-time, bi-directional communication. The client send the messages over the websocket. When the jupyter_server receives this message it puts this message on a `shell channel` over zeromq. This message when received by the kernel  triggers a computation in the kernel. The kernel emits the output on `iopub channel` over zeromq. This message is received by Jupyter server and the output is put on websocket.

## Methodology

The benchmarking setup follows a controlled and repeatable process:

### 1. Session Initialization
A session is created and a WebSocket connection is established using a goroutine.

### 2. Execution Requests
A stream of `execute_request` kernel messages is sent over the websocket.

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
System metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution throughput are recorded at 10-second intervals. These are visualized for comparison.

## Steps to run

* Setting up the benchmark code
```
git clone https://github.com/zasper-io/zasper-benchmark
cd zasper-benchmark
# Install go dependencides
go mod tidy
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Setting environment variables
```
DELAY=10
TOKEN=0f246b68d418b3eeeaee4f2432b42927aa2458a278523114
XSRF_TOKEN=2|42679dac|baa53312a6f622e92be800d4bf32b02c|1743152726
NUM_KERNELS=64
TARGET=jupyter

```

`DELAY` is the time duration between two subsequent message requests to a kernel. 

`NUM_KERNELS` : Number of kernel connections you want to create.

`TARGET`: Define whether you are measuring the performace of jupyter or zasper.

`PID`: the process id of `jupyterlab` or `zasper` once you start the process.

`TOKEN`: the `api_token` of jupyterlab session.

`XSRF_TOKEN`: collect it via the browser. In Jupyterlab ui Open developer tools > Application . Copy the `xsrf_token`.


* Collecting data for zasper

1. Start Zasper

2. Start the monitoring code
```
go run .
```
Run with `--debug` flag to see the `requests` and `responses` happening in real time.

```
go run . --debug
```

```
prasunanand@Prasuns-Mac-mini zasper-benchmark % go run .

The program writes the output to `data/benchmark_results_zasper_2kernels.json` file.

* Collecting data for Jupyterlab

1. Start JupyterLab.
2. You need to get `api_token` and `xsrf_token` and paste it in the `.env` file.
3. Start the monitoring code
```
go run .
```
The program writes the output to `benchmark_results_jupyterlab.json`

* Visualize the data

```
python3 visualize.py --delay=10 --n=64
```
```
python3 visualize_resources_summary.py --delay=10
```


## System Specifications

* OS : macOS
* CPU : Apple M4, 10-core CPU
* RAM: 16GB

Note: A typical IPython kernel consumes around 80 MB of RAM on avaerage.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zasper-io/zasper-benchmark/refs/heads/main/assets/idle_ram.png)

(RAM usage on M4 Mac mini)

On my M4 Mac mini, I can see that leftover RAM is around 9 GB , hence the number of kernels that can fit on my machine is 9GB/80MB = 112 ~= 100 Jupyter kernels.

On an M3 Macbook Air which has just 8GB RAM, the leftover RAM tends to be around 1GB RAM , so we can fit ~10 Ipython kernels running on that machine.

Hence, if you want to run the benchmarks make sure that you have enough RAM for the kernels, else you might end up with results that won't make sense.

# Results

The graph shows a clear performance difference between Zasper and Jupyter Server across the selected metrics.

* Lower CPU uasage and RAM usage is better.
* Higher Message sent and  Message receievd is better
* Higher Message sent per second (throughput) and Message received per second (throughput)  is better.

### Observations

* Zasper consumer lesser CPU and lesser Memory in all cases.
* For (64 kernels at 10RPS) and (16kernel at 100RPS), Jupyter server starts loosing kernel connections.
* For (100kernels at 10RPS) Jupyter server loose all kernel connections. Message received throughput falls to 0. Zeromq message queues get overloaded
* For (64 kernels at 100RPS) both Zasper and Jupyter server loose all kernel connections. At this point, the Jupyter kernels get overwhelmed and zeromq message queues get overloaded.

## Explaining the crash

### Zasper crash


*  Zasper crashed under very high loads compared to Jupyter Server.
* At 32 kernels, 100 RPS per kernel, the through drops but kernel connections are not lost.
* At (64 kernels, 100RPS per kernel), the zeromq message queue fills up
as the **Jupyter kernel** doesnt consume the messages fast and the queue fills up completely, leading to lost kernel connections.

{"level":"error","error":"zmq4: read/write on closed connection","time":1745735834,"message":"failed to send message"}
```

### Jupyter Server Crash

* Jupyter Server tends to crash at lower request throughput due to:
  1. Message queues filling up faster because execute_reply messages are not consumed quickly enough from the ZeroMQ queues.
  2. Tornado coroutines running on a single core, combined with Python's limited scalability, result in websocket connection failures between the client and the server.
  3. Resource contention between Tornado, ZeroMQ, and the Jupyter kernels, competing for CPU and RAM.
  3. Garbage collection (GC) further degrading performance under load.


* At 64 kernels, 10RPS per kernel, JupyterLab stops to loose kernel connection and at 100 kernels, 10 RPS per kernel it looses all kernel connections.

### Key observations:

* CPU Usage: Zasper maintained consistently lower CPU usage during heavy load.
* RAM Usage: Memory consumption was significantly lower for Zasper.
* Throughput: Zasper handled more execution requests per unit of time, indicating better scalability under concurrent workloads.
* Latency: Under extremely high load, the latency drops for both JupyterLab and Zasper. However Zasper has much lower latency compared to Jupyter Server.
* Resilience: Zasper is a lot more resilient compared to Jupyterlab, and can easily recover.

## Why Zasper Outperforms Jupyter Server

Go is a compiled language with native support for concurrency and multi-core scalability, whereas Python is an interpreted language that primarily runs on a single core. This fundamental difference gives **Zasper**, built in Go, a significant performance advantage over **Jupyter Server**, which is built in Python.

Jupyter Server uses the **Tornado** web server, which is built around Python‚Äôs **asyncio** framework for handling asynchronous requests. In contrast, Zasper leverages Go‚Äôs **Gorilla** server, which utilizes Go‚Äôs lightweight **goroutines** for concurrency. While both are asynchronous in nature, goroutines are much more efficient and cheaper to schedule compared to Python‚Äôs event-loop-based coroutines.

In Jupyter Server, submitting a request to the ZeroMQ channels involves packaging an asynchronous function into the asyncio event loop, along with futures and callbacks. The loop must then schedule and manage these functions‚Äîan operation that introduces overhead. Zasper, on the other hand, creates goroutines with minimal scheduling cost, making the process significantly faster.

While Python‚Äôs asyncio and Go‚Äôs goroutines share similar architectural goals, Go's model is much closer to the hardware. It schedules coroutines across multiple CPU threads seamlessly, while Python is limited by the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**, preventing true multi-core parallelism.

When request handling slows down in Jupyter Server, memory usage climbs, CPU gets overwhelmed, and the garbage collector (GC) starts to intervene‚Äîoften resulting in degraded performance. Under high loads and constrained reource, the situation gets even bad because of JupyterLab, Zeromq and Jupyter kernel all compete for resources, leading to Jupyter server websocket connections getting lost.

Zasper also crashes but under extremely high loads when Zeromq kernels fill up as Jupyter kernels get overwhelmed. Zasper has much higher resiliency.

Zasper is designed around the principle of **‚ÄúUse More to Save More.‚Äù** As request volume increases, Zasper‚Äôs efficiency becomes more apparent. Its architecture thrives under load, delivering better throughput and stability at scale.


## Benefits of Zasper
